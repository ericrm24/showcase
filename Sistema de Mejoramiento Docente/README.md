# *Sistema de Mejoramiento Docente*
This is project that integrated the acquired knowledge of two courses: **Software Engineering** and **Databases**.

The fictional scenario was to implement a system that allowed for the evaluation of professors at the University of Costa Rica.

### Language: C#
Along with the use of SQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Methodology: Scrum of Scrums
The project had 4 teams of 4 or 6 developers each.

### Architecture: MVC

### My contribution
My team was responsible for the **Users, Profiles, Permissions and Administration** area. As such, most of the database was designed by us, and we had to guarantee that every action in the system was performed by an authorized user. We also provided security for sensitive information, along with a safe way to reset or change users' passwords, among other similar responsibilities.
